## TheiaMeta_Panel_Illumina_PE_PHB

TheiaMeta_Panel was created initially for the Illumina Viral Surveillance Panel; however, it can be used for any panel that is sequenced using Illumina paired-end reads if the appropriate taxon IDs are provided. TheiaMeta_Panel performs taxonomic binning, and then assembles the bins into contigs. If the contigs are associated with a supported organism, genomic characterization will be performed.

### Workflow Tasks


??? task "`read_QC_trim`: Read Quality Trimming, Adapter Removal, Quantification, and Identification"

    `read_QC_trim` is a sub-workflow within TheiaMeta that removes low-quality reads, low-quality regions of reads, and sequencing adapters to improve data quality. It uses a number of tasks, described below.

    **Read quality trimming**

    Either `trimmomatic` or `fastp` can be used for read-quality trimming. Trimmomatic is used by default. Both tools trim low-quality regions of reads with a sliding window (with a window size of `trim_window_size`), cutting once the average quality within the window falls below `trim_quality_trim_score`. They will both discard the read if it is trimmed below `trim_minlen`. 

    If fastp is selected for analysis, fastp also implements the additional read-trimming steps indicated below:

    | **Parameter** | **Explanation** |
    | --- | --- |
    | -g | enables polyG tail trimming |
    | -5 20 | enables read end-trimming |
    | -3 20 | enables read end-trimming |
    | --detect_adapter_for_pe | enables adapter-trimming **only for paired-end reads** |

    **Adapter removal**

    The `BBDuk` task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:

    - [Repair](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/repair-guide/) from the [BBTools](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/) package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files.
    - [BBDuk](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)  (*"Bestus Bioinformaticus" Decontamination Using Kmers*) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to [PhiX](https://emea.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/cluster-gen-sequencing-reagents/phix-control-v3.html), which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.
    
    ??? toggle "What are adapters and why do they need to be removed?"
        Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters [here](https://emea.support.illumina.com/bulletins/2020/06/illumina-adapter-portfolio.html). For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.
        
    **Read Quantification**

    There are two methods for read quantification to choose from: [`fastq-scan`](https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-scan) (default) or [`fastqc`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Both quantify the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ files. In TheiaProk_Illumina_PE, they also provide the total number of read pairs. This task is run once with raw reads as input and once with clean reads as input. If QC has been performed correctly, you should expect **fewer** clean reads than raw reads. `fastqc` also provides a graphical visualization of the read quality.

    **Read Identification (optional)**

    The `MIDAS` task is for the identification of reads to detect contamination with non-target taxa. This task is optional and turned off by default. It can be used by setting the `call_midas` input variable to `true`.

    The MIDAS tool was originally designed for metagenomic sequencing data but has been co-opted for use with bacterial isolate WGS methods. It can be used to detect contamination present in raw sequencing data by estimating bacterial species abundance in bacterial isolate WGS data. If a secondary genus is detected above a relative frequency of 0.01 (1%), then the sample should fail QC and be investigated further for potential contamination.

    This task is similar to those used in commercial software, BioNumerics, for estimating secondary species abundance.

    ??? toggle "How are the MIDAS output columns determined?"
        
        Example MIDAS report in the `midas_report` column:
        
        | species_id | count_reads | coverage | relative_abundance |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | Salmonella_enterica_58156 | 3309 | 89.88006645 | 0.855888033 |
        | Salmonella_enterica_58266 | 501 | 11.60606061 | 0.110519371 |
        | Salmonella_enterica_53987 | 99 | 2.232896237 | 0.021262881 |
        | Citrobacter_youngae_61659 | 46 | 0.995216227 | 0.009477003 |
        | Escherichia_coli_58110 | 5 | 0.123668877 | 0.001177644 |
        
        MIDAS report column descriptions:
        
        - species_id: species identifier
        - count_reads: number of reads mapped to marker genes
        - coverage: estimated genome-coverage (i.e. read-depth) of species in metagenome
        - relative_abundance: estimated relative abundance of species in metagenome
        
        The value in the `midas_primary_genus` column is derived by ordering the rows in order of "relative_abundance" and identifying the genus of top species in the "species_id" column (Salmonella). The value in the `midas_secondary_genus` column is derived from the genus of the second-most prevalent genus in the "species_id" column (Citrobacter). The `midas_secondary_genus_abundance` column is the "relative_abundance" of the second-most prevalent genus (0.009477003). The `midas_secondary_genus_coverage` is the "coverage" of the second-most prevalent genus (0.995216227).
        
    Alternatively to `MIDAS`, the `Kraken2` task can also be turned on through setting the `call_kraken` input variable as `true` for the identification of reads to detect contamination with non-target taxa.

    Kraken2 is a bioinformatics tool originally designed for metagenomic applications. It has additionally proven valuable for validating taxonomic assignments and checking contamination of single-species (e.g. bacterial isolate) whole genome sequence data. A database must be provided if this optional module is activated, through the kraken_db optional input. A list of suggested databases can be found on [Kraken2 standalone documentation](../standalone/kraken2.md).

??? task "`kraken`: Taxonomic Classification"

    Kraken2 is a bioinformatics tool originally designed for metagenomic applications. It has additionally proven valuable for validating taxonomic assignments and checking contamination of single-species (e.g. bacterial isolate, eukaryotic isolate, viral isolate, etc.) whole genome sequence data.

    Kraken2 is run on the set of raw reads, provided as input, as well as the set of clean reads that are resulted from the `read_QC_trim` workflow

    !!! info "Database-dependent"
        The Kraken2 software is database-dependent and **taxonomic assignments are highly sensitive to the database used**. An appropriate database should contain the expected organism(s) (e.g. _Escherichia coli_) and other taxa that may be present in the reads (e.g. _Citrobacter freundii_, a common contaminant).
