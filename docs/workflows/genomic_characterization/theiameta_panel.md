## TheiaMeta_Panel_Illumina_PE_PHB

TheiaMeta_Panel was created initially for the Illumina Viral Surveillance Panel; however, it can be used for any panel that is sequenced using Illumina paired-end reads if the appropriate taxon IDs are provided. TheiaMeta_Panel performs taxonomic binning, and then assembles the bins into contigs. If the contigs are associated with a supported organism, genomic characterization will be performed.
